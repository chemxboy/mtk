###build_rsync###
A helper for building the latest rsync, complete with all Mac-specific patches.

###hellyes###
A stress test which starts a yes process per every core and then generates IO on the boot drive by creating 10k, 100k, 1m and 10m files in the /tmp/_hellyes folder.

###blooper###
The Boot Looper is another stress test which opens up a bunch of applications and then
reboots the machine. Very effective when used inside login items. Has two modes of operation:
- Run as is. This launches the first 5 apps from /Applications
- Create a folder called "TestApps" on your desktop and drag aliases into it. This will only launch the apps inside this folder.
